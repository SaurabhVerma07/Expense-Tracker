Here is my new project for Codealpha.<br>
This project is all About An Expense tracker . <br>
What is Expense Tracker? <br>
An expense tracker is a tool or application designed to help individuals or organizations monitor and manage their expenses. <br>
Its primary purpose is to record where money is spent, categorize expenses, and provide insights into spending habits. <br>
Expense trackers are often used to maintain budgets, control overspending, and achieve financial goals.<br>
Why Use an Expense Tracker? <br>
Control Spending: Helps identify areas where you may be overspending. <br>
Budget Adherence: Ensures you stick to financial goals. <br>
Debt Reduction: Tracks repayment progress.<br>
Savings Goals: Allocates funds efficiently for future plans.<br>
Financial Awareness: Provides a clear view of income versus expenses. <br>
Whether you're an individual managing a personal budget or a business handling operational costs, an expense tracker is an essential tool for financial discipline.<br>
